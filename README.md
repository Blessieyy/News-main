# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# News App ðŸ“°
This is a simple React News App that fetches the latest news articles from an external API (NewsAPI.org) and displays them in a user-friendly format. The app uses React's Context API for state management and Axios for HTTP requests.

# Features
Display the latest news articles.
Fetch articles from different categories (e.g., general, business, sports).
Responsive layout.
Uses React Hooks (useContext, useEffect, useState) for managing state and lifecycle events.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:

Node.js (v14.x or later)
npm or yarn
An API key from NewsAPI.org

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-app.git
cd news-app
Install dependencies:

npm install
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your NewsAPI key:


REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Start the development server:


npm start
The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

# Usage
The app will automatically fetch the latest news articles when you load the page.
You can switch categories to see articles from different news sections (requires integration of a category selector).
Project Structure
